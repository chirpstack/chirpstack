# Key encryption keys (KEKs).
#
# KEKs can be used to encrypt session-keys between two endpoints,
# for example a Join Server and Network Server, or between two
# Network Servers in case of a roaming agreement. If used, the
# sender will encrypt the session-key with the KEK and indicates
# to the receiver the label of the KEK that was used for encryption,
# such that the receiver is able to decrypt the session-key.
#
# Example (can be repeated):
# [[keks]]
#
#   # KEK label.
#   label="kek-label"

#   # Encryption key.
#   kek="01020304050607080102030405060708"
