    # Example:
    # [[join_server.servers]]

    #   # JoinEUI prefix that must be routed to the Join Server.

    #   # join_eui_prefix will be used to match against the JoinEUI.
    #   # Thus the following JoinEUI range will be forwarded to the
    #   # configured Join Server:
    #   #   0102030405060700 - 01020304050607ff

# Key encryption keys (KEKs).
#
# KEKs can be used to encrypt session-keys between two endpoints,
# for example a Join Server and Network Server, or between two
# Network Servers in case of a roaming agreement. If used, the
# sender will encrypt the session-key with the KEK and indicates
# to the receiver the label of the KEK that was used for encryption,
# such that the receiver is able to decrypt the session-key.
#
# Example (can be repeated):
# [[keks]]
#
#   # KEK label.
#   label="kek-label"

#   # Encryption key.
